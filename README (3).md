   - **Data Visualizations**: Visualizations such as distribution plots, box plots, and heatmaps are generated for a better understanding of the data.

### 3. Insights & Reporting
After the analysis is complete, the tool will generate:
   - **Statistical Summary Report**: A detailed summary of all calculated statistics.
   - **Visualizations**: All generated charts are saved as PNG files for easy sharing and inclusion in reports.
   - **Narrative Insights**: Using OpenAIâ€™s models, the tool produces a written analysis summarizing key findings, trends, and insights from the data.

### 4. Save and Export
Once the analysis is complete, you can:
   - Download the statistical summary as a text or CSV file.
   - Download the generated visualizations as PNG files.
   - Export the generated narrative report.
